			<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If you don't know already, this is a profile pack for Honorbuddy!</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>What is Honorbuddy? It's an artificial intelligence program designed to automate the repetitive tasks in World of Warcraft.		You'd probably recognize it as a &quot;bot.&quot;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This profile pack is designed to farm items of interest, transmog sets and grind dungeons.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Scroll down to get more information about each farm category. Or navigate using the menu at the top.</p>

	      <h1><strong>Transmog Farms</strong></h1>
	      <h2>The oldest in the pack!</h2>
	      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
	      <h3>Purpose</h3>
	      <p>These profiles are designed to farm <strong>entire</strong> sets of transmog gear.</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <h3>Tips</h3>
	      <p><strong><em>Tier Recolor</em></strong> profiles aren't designed to vendor, mail or repair. However, while running the dungeon they will only loot the boss that drops the item.</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p><strong><em>Subset</em></strong> profiles will vendor, mail and repair. Some Subset profiles will randomize the farming locations to avoid suspicion, locations will randomize between vendor runs. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <h3><strong>Tier Recolors</strong></h3>
	      <p> These are items that are modeled to look like tier set items, however they're recolored! An example of a Tier and it's Recolor would be the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/search?q=netherwind+regalia" class="linkf" target="_blank">Netherwind Regalia</a>, tier 2 for mages.</p>
	      <p>Profiles in this pack will be tagged with: [HD] [ND] and (RC)</p>
	        <p>- [HD] is Heroic Difficulty, these items will only be farmed once daily.</p>
	        <p>- [ND] is Normal Difficulty, these items will be farmed until obtained.</p>
	        <p>- (RC) is Recolor, this tag tells you that the items farmed will be a recolored version of the set. </p>
	      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
	      <p>&nbsp; </p>
	      <h3>Subsets</h3>
	      <p>These are items that aren't actually sets, but match together. Subsets are usually dropped in the environment and are BoE, so they can be sold for a profit.</p>
	      <p>An example of a subset would be the<a href="http://wowhead.com/transmog-set=14" class="linkf" target="_blank"> Buccaneer's Regalia</a>.</p>

		<h1><strong>Dungeon Farms</strong></h1>
		<h2>Some dungeon farms utilize the [DD] system!</h2>
		<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>These profiles are designed to farm dungeons whether it be for enchanting materials, gold farms, rare item hunting, achievement farming or for reputation farms.		</p>
		<p>These profiles will kill and loot (almost) every mob in the dungeon, and they're usually slow paced.</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>These profiles have a mail, vendor, and repair routine. This routine will activate when the user has less than 10 bagslots after finishing an instance. The bot will not mail if you do not have a &quot;Mail To&quot; set in Honorbuddy's settings.</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;   </h3>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h3>What's [DD]?</h3>
		<p>[DD] is the Detection Diamond.		</p>
		<p>Prior to entering the instance, the bot will pause and ask you how you want the instance ran.		</p>
		<p>Some options are: Heroic Mode, Regular Mode, Lv.90 Gold Farm, Lv.85 Gold Farm.</p>
		<p>Each mode will be optimized for whichever option you pick. </p>
		<p>(ex: The Lv.90 gold farm will pull huge packs of mobs whereas the Lv.85 gold farm will pull smaller packs.)</p>

			<h1><strong>Item Farming</strong></h1>
			<h2>Mounts, Rares, Gold and more!</h2>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Profiles in this pack are dedicated to farm rare mobs, pets, mounts, gold, reputation and basically anything else - until stopped by the user!</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <h3>Tips</h3>
			<p>Sometimes profiles in this pack will farm transmog items, but do not confuse this with the other transmog profiles. Anytime there's a profile in this category that farms a transmog, it will only be farming <em><strong>one specific item.</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
			<p>The transmog farming category is for <em><strong>entire armor sets. </strong></em><strong></strong></p>
			<p>These profiles will vendor, mail and repair.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Extra			</h3>
			<p>These profiles may be risky to use, they behave a lot like a typical 'grind' bot which simply means it will repetitively kill and farm the exact same mobs over and over until stopped by the user.</p>
			<p>Please limit your farm time while using these profiles!</p>

		<h1><strong>Need-To-Know!</strong></h1>
		<h2>You need to know this.		</h2>
		  <p>- All profiles in this pack operate on the 'Questing' botbase!</p>
		  <p>- Some profiles may require you to be in a specific location. You may want to start the bot in Stormwind or Orgrimmar!</p>
		  <p>-  Some profiles in this pack need behaviors, however the behaviors are still being re-coded and currently do not work.</p>
		  <p>- Not every profile will vendor / mail / repair!</p>
		  <p>- These profiles have dated code, so some things may not work properly! I'm in the process of fixing them.</p>
		  <p>- Have questions? <a href="http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-profiles/farming/140913-instance-grinds-transmog-farms.html#post1338972" class="linkf" target="_blank">Post them here</a>.</p>

		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <h3>Extra notes and Thank You's</h3>
		<p>I'd like to give a big thanks to Chinajade and Kickz's Code for helping me with my code struggles starting out!</p>
		<p>Also, a big thanks goes to Bengan for writing the universal transport code that's used in almost all of my profiles.</p>
		<p>And one last big-thanks to the community for driving my motivation to make these profiles!</p>
