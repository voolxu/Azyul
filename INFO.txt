<-PROFILE INFORMATION->


-	ENDLESS FARM PACK---
Endless farm profiles are profiles dedicated to farming specific mobs until stopped by the user.
Some endless farm packs may farm rare pets, mounts, gold, or other items of value.

Some Endless farm profiles may run/farm dungeons.
Do not confuse these with the "Instance Grind" profiles in the Instance Grind section.

When an Endless Farm Pack is set to run a dungeon, it usually avoids, skips or doesn't loot mobs and bosses 
to optimize runs-per-hour while the Instance Grind profiles are optimized for drops-per-hour.

One example would be Stratholme - Rivendare Mount farm.
The Endless Farm pack version of this profile will only loot the mount.
And the Instance Grind version of this profile will loot everything.

-	INSTANCE GRINDS---
Instance Grind profiles are profiles dedicated to completely clearing specific dungeons and raids.
These profiles will focus on killing+looting (almost) every mob in the instance, and are usually slow-paced.
These profiles are also intended for solo use only, and are not designed to be ran with other bots/people.

Some of these profiles will also run attunement quests for specific raids if needed.  (Ex: Molten Core)

-	TRANSMOG FARMS---
Transmog Farm profiles will focus purely on obtaining sets of transmogrification gear.

"Environmental Transmog Farms" will focus on killing mobs around the world that drop BoE armor/weapons.
These sets are usually referred to as 'subsets' and typically have names such as: "Chestpiece of the Owl" or "Chestpiece of the Tiger."


"Instance Transmog Farms" will focus on farming instances for recolor (RC) sets.
Some recolors include:  Tier2, Tier1, Dungeon1, Dungeon2, Dungeon3, and many others.
An example recolor set would be the Tier 2 recolor of Netherwind Regalia:
