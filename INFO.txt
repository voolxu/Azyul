-	TRANSMOG FARMS---
Transmog Farm profiles will focus purely on obtaining sets of transmogrification gear.

"Environmental Transmog Farms" will focus on killing mobs around the world that drop BoE armor/weapons.
These sets are usually refered to as 'subsets' and typically have names such as: "Chestpiece of the Owl" or "Chestpiece of the Tiger."


"Instance Transmog Farms" will focus on farming instances for recolor (RC) sets.
Some recolors include:  Tier2, Tier1, Dungeon1, Dungeon2, Dungeon3, and many others.
An example recolor set would be the Tier 2 recolor of Netherwind Regalia:
