                        <p>The eMog mega pack is an Honorbuddy profile pack that features Questing  profiles dedicated to farming instances, transmog gear, rare mounts and other items of interest.    All     profiles        are organised in sections, the sections being:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Instance Grinds</li>
                          <li>Farming Profiles</li>
                          <li>Transmog Farms</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>More sections may be added in the future. Read below for details on each section.</p>

                <p>Transmog Farm profiles will focus purely on obtaining sets of transmogrification gear.</p>
                <p>&quot;Environmental Transmog Farms&quot; will focus on killing mobs around the world that drop BoE armor/weapons.<br />
                  These sets are usually referred to as 'subsets' and typically have names such as: &quot;Chestpiece of the Owl&quot; or &quot;Chestpiece of the Tiger.&quot;<br />
            </p>
                <p>&quot;Instance Transmog Farms&quot; will focus on farming instances for recolor (RC) sets.<br />
                  Some recolors include:  Tier2, Tier1, Dungeon1, Dungeon2, Dungeon3, and many others.<br />
                  An example recolor set would be the Tier 2 recolor of<strong> Netherwind Regalia</strong>: <br />

        <p>These profiles are the oldest in the pack. &nbsp;&nbsp; Originally this pack was created completely for instance transmogs considering the lack of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profiles that existed in the community at the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time.</p>
        <p>Age has took its toll on these profiles, a lot of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the code used in them are outdated or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreliable.  Also, the profiles aren't nearly as flexable as the current Instance Grind profiles.</p>
        <p><strong>Some details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>[HD] profiles farm heroic drops.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>[ND] profiles farm normal drops.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>(RC) means Recolor.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Start the profiles in Outlands.</strong></li>
        </ul>

                <p class="heading2">Information: </p>
                <p>Instance Grind profiles are profiles dedicated to completely clearing specific dungeons and raids.<br />
                        These profiles will focus on killing+looting (almost) every mob in the instance, and are usually slow-paced.<br />
                These profiles are also intended for solo use only, and are not designed to be ran with other bots/people.</p>
                      <p>Some of these profiles will also run attunement quests for specific raids if needed.  (Ex: Molten Core)</p>

        <p>The instance grinds profiles have become &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bulk of our work in this pack.  These profiles aren't typically used for optimized farming, but &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are an easy solution if you want specific items &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a dungeon that you don't want to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeatively run.  At the moment, all instance &nbsp;&nbsp; grinds are coded on normal instance difficulties.  Considering most dungeons heroic/normal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settings have no difference - we will not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prioritize making heroic-specific dungeons until &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the normal farms are complete.</p>

              <p class="heading2">Information: </p>
                      <p>The Farm Pack profiles are profiles dedicated to farming specific mobs until stopped by the user.<br />
                  Some endless farm packs may farm rare mobs, rare pets, mounts, gold, or other items of value.</p>
                      <p>Some Farm Pack profiles may run/farm dungeons.<br />
                        Do not confuse these with the &quot;Instance Grind&quot; profiles in the Instance Grind section.</p>
                      <p>When an Farm Pack profile is set to run a dungeon, it usually avoids, skips or doesn't loot mobs and bosses <br />
                        to optimize runs-per-hour while the Instance Grind profiles are optimized for drops-per-hour.</p>
                      <p>One example would be Stratholme - Rivendare Mount farm.<br />
                        The Farm Pack version of this profile will only loot the mount.<br />
                        And the Instance Grind version of this profile will loot everything.<br />

            <div class="heading2">Extra Information:</div>
        <p>The farming pack idea came up later in our endevour. Similar to Instance Grind profiles, &nbsp; except these profiles focus on farming specific &nbsp; mobs inside of the instances rather than  doing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full runs! Farming Packs usually don't follow our typical code templates/structure and may do &nbsp; things that other profiles don't.  Most farming &nbsp; packs are off-spawns of our Instance Grind&nbsp;&nbsp; profiles.  When coding an instance profile, we &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may see a group of mobs in the instance that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are farm-worthy.  That's where a farm profile will come in play.  One good example is the trash &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mobs in Karazhan.</p>
        <p>These profiles will also farm outside of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instances, as posted in the text to the left - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these profiles will farm mounts, rare items, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gold and more!</p>

                                All profiles run on the &quot;Questing&quot; botbase.</div>
<p>Some profiles may require you to be in a specific location before starting.  Typically Stormwind or Orgrimmar are recommended starting spots.</p>
<p>Some profiles also require Quest Behaviors. You must copy over the Quest Behaviors from our pack to your Honorbuddy folder.</p>
